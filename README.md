# Enhanced Calculator

A Python command-line calculator with a continuous read-evaluate-print loop
(REPL), six arithmetic operations, undo/redo, and pandas-backed CSV history.
The implementation is split into focused modules and demonstrates Strategy,
Factory, Observer, Memento, and Facade patterns.

## Features

- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power, and nth root
- Named operations, aliases, and symbols
- Persistent CSV history with startup loading and optional automatic saving
- `help`, `history`, `clear`, `undo`, `redo`, `save`, `load`, and exit commands
- Input validation and clear errors for invalid input and unsupported results
- Logging and observer notifications for calculator state changes
- Pytest suite with 100% statement and branch coverage enforced in CI

## Requirements

- Python 3.11 or newer
- pip
- Runtime packages: `colorama`, `pandas`, and `python-dotenv`

## Setup

Run the following from the repository root. The virtual environment keeps the
project's Python packages separate from other installations.

### Windows PowerShell

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

If script activation is blocked, enable it for the current PowerShell process
and activate the environment again:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

### macOS or Linux

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

The editable install includes the runtime packages and the optional
development packages (`pytest` and `pytest-cov`).

## Run the calculator

From the repository root, start the REPL with:

```console
python -m app.calculator_repl
```

Choose an operation and enter its two operands when prompted:

```text
Choose an operation: add
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Result: 15.0
Choose an operation: history
1. 10.0 + 5.0 = 15.0
Choose an operation: exit
Goodbye!
```

For root, enter the radicand first and the degree second: choosing `root` and
entering `27` then `3` returns `3`. Negative radicands require an odd integer
degree. Zero-degree roots and non-real results are rejected.

## Operations and aliases

| Operation | Accepted inputs | Operand order |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Addition | `add`, `sum`, `+` | first + second |
| Subtraction | `subtract`, `minus`, `-` | first - second |
| Multiplication | `multiply`, `times`, `*` | first * second |
| Division | `divide`, `div`, `/` | first / second |
| Power | `power`, `pow`, `^` | first raised to second |
| Nth root | `root`, `nthroot`, `√` | root of first with degree second |

Inputs must be finite numbers. Division by zero, invalid operations, malformed
numbers, and results outside the supported real-number domain are reported as
errors; failed calculations are not added to history.

## REPL commands

| Command | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `help` | Show commands, operations, and aliases |
| `history` | Display the current calculation history |
| `clear` | Clear history; the change can be undone |
| `undo` | Restore the prior history state, if available |
| `redo` | Reapply an undone state, if available |
| `save` | Write history to the configured CSV path |
| `load` | Replace history from the configured CSV file |
| `exit`, `quit`, `q` | Exit the REPL |

`load` resets the undo and redo stacks. A new calculation clears the redo
stack. Missing or invalid CSV files produce an error; the REPL remains
available so the user can continue or exit.

## Configuration

Settings can be provided as process environment variables or in a `.env` file
in the working directory. Process environment variables take precedence over
`.env`. The checked-in `.env.example` lists the defaults; copy it to `.env` to
customize local settings. `.env` is ignored by Git.

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CALCULATOR_HISTORY_FILE` | `calculator_history.csv` | History CSV path; must have a `.csv` extension |
| `CALCULATOR_AUTOSAVE_HISTORY` | `true` | Automatically persist state changes; accepts `true`/`false`, `1`/`0`, `yes`/`no`, and `on`/`off` |
| `CALCULATOR_LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO` | One of `CRITICAL`, `ERROR`, `WARNING`, `INFO`, or `DEBUG` |

The configured CSV is loaded at startup when it exists. When auto-save is
enabled, successful calculations and history changes (clear, undo, redo, and
load) are saved automatically. Disabling auto-save leaves manual `save` and
`load` available. Invalid settings are reported before the REPL starts.

CSV history stores the first operand, canonical operation name, and second
operand. Results are recalculated when history is displayed.

## Python API

Use the calculation factory for a single calculation:

```python
from app.calculation import CalculationFactory

calculation = CalculationFactory.create_calculation(12, "*", 3)
print(calculation.calculate())  # 36
```

The `calculate(first_number, operation, second_number)` helper provides the
same dispatch behavior without retaining a `Calculation` object. To use the
facade with observers and state history:

```python
from app.calculator import Calculator
from app.calculator_observers import AutoSaveHistoryObserver, LoggingObserver

calculator = Calculator(
    observers=[
        LoggingObserver(),
        AutoSaveHistoryObserver("calculator_history.csv"),
    ]
)
print(calculator.calculate(2, "power", 3))
calculator.undo()
calculator.redo()
```

## Design and project layout

- **Strategy and Factory:** `OperationFactory` selects an operation strategy;
  `CalculationFactory` normalizes operation aliases and creates calculations.
- **Observer:** `Calculator` broadcasts state changes to registered observers.
  The built-in observers log events and automatically persist CSV history.
- **Memento:** immutable `CalculatorMemento` snapshots provide undo and redo.
- **Facade:** `Calculator` coordinates operations, history, observers, and
  state restoration.

## Tests and coverage

Run all tests:

```console
python -m pytest
```

Measure statement and branch coverage and require both to reach 100%:

```console
python -m pytest --cov=app --cov-branch --cov-report=term-missing --cov-fail-under=100
```

Coverage exclusions should be reserved for code that cannot meaningfully be
exercised. `# pragma: no cover` excludes a marked line (and may exclude a
conditional clause); `# pragma: no branch` identifies an intentionally partial
branch. Do not exclude reachable code just to raise the coverage percentage:
add tests for those paths. This project currently has no coverage exclusions.

## Continuous integration

The GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/python-tests.yml` installs
the project and development dependencies, runs pytest with branch coverage,
and fails if total coverage is below 100%.
